        <p class="lead">Here is where I share my deep thoughts and reflections on the article.</p>
        <p> What do people want? Clearly, the best situation for an individual is that everyone else follows the rules 
            and do the hard job, but the individual themselves cheats, gaining the most benefit.</p>

        <p> So for the individual, the best solution is that the all the big corprations create the web technilogies, 
            while they just use them for free. Essentially the big corprations do all the hard work for no reason. 
        </p>

        <p> The Mozzila article mentions the balance between commericalism and public good. But the quesiton is how we can 
            achieve the balance?

            One may insist on the antagonistic relationship between the individual and the society, which I think is often overlooked.

            The world is not a charity and people do things for their own good. In fact, most technologies that people brag for their 
            openness are actually created by big companies for their own benefits.

            The internet is designed to be free, but it costs a lot to maintain the freedom. Freedom costs money.
        </p>

        <p> Are the public infrastructures, such as roads and bridges, free? No, they are built by the government using tax money,
            and even more sadly, people don't have the power to decide how the money is used.
