        <h2 class="title-section">Some Reflections on the Reading Materials</h2>
        <p class="lead">Here is where I share my deep thoughts and reflections on the articles.</p>
        <p>The first idea I have is that, wow, this article is very biased. 
            The author strongly encourages the "openness" of the web and advocates the adoption of open technologies,
            which are technologies that can be freely used, modified, and shared, for innovation and collaboration.

            However, suppose that we are the big corprations that create these open technologies.
            In that case, the best situation is to make it proprietary so that we can charge other people money.

            This already raises the attention to different interests groups. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the article, the author mentions the example of apple's iTunes as a example of the opposite of open technologies. 
            However, the iTunes store is a great success for Apple and well as artists who registered on Apple.  
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also another famous counter-example, which is the Pirate Bay, a somewhat controversial website that shares copyrighted materials for free.
            The Pirate Bay is definately an success for users who want to get free stuff, but it is bad for the artists who create the materials.
